# A-comparison-between-XGBoost-and-DNN-models-for-customer-churn-prediction

### What does it do?

It builds an XGBoost Classifier as well as a Dense Neural Network (DNN) classifier for the IBM Telco Churn dataset.

### What were the tools used?

- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Imblearn
- Statsmodels
- Scikitlearn
- PyTorch
- XGBoost
- Itertools
- Time

### Why have I made it?

While taking advanced machine learning and deep learning classes for my masters in Data Science at DePaul I had the opportunity to learn about multiple distinct models. I became curious about how a simple deep learning model would compare to a state of the art tree based model in terms of complexity to build, running time and performance. Because of that, I decided to compare an XGBoost Classifier with a DNN Classifier for customer churn, using the well known IBM Telco customer churn dataset.

### PS:

The original notebook "A comparison between XGBoost and DNN models for customer churn prediction" is too large and won't open on the browser, but is included for download. I created the "Pre-Process" and "Training and evaluating" notebooks, which are not functional, but can be opened on the browser. However, these notebooks are still large seeing that they include lots of charts and control print statements for the training process. Because of that, I included a pdf file ("Article format") which is easier to read. Lastly, I also included the presentation file ("DSC540 - Final project presentation_Lucas_de_Oliveira") in case someone would rather listen to it rather than read it.
